# coffeeshop-data-analysis-powerbi
In this project, I analyzed a coffee shop dataset to extract meaningful business insights and support data-driven decision-making.

The analysis focused on:

Calculating total costs and revenues for each product

Identifying the best-selling products

Evaluating customer satisfaction levels

Analyzing sales trends to observe increases or decreases across different months and days

Based on these insights, actionable decisions were derived to improve performance, optimize product offerings, and enhance customer experience.
